{"id":"source-r1l","title":"Revisit CPU architecture vs SAU vs feature-level code organization","description":"The current code organization uses SAU (System Architecture Unit) numbers for platform-specific code splits (e.g., ec/sau2/advance.s). However, this conflates several different concerns:\n\n1. **CPU architecture** (m68k vs x86 vs ARM) - instruction set, calling conventions, register usage\n2. **SAU variants** (sau1, sau2, etc.) - Apollo-specific hardware configurations\n3. **Feature-level differences** - e.g., MMU type, peripheral support\n\nThe ec/sau2/*.s files contain m68k assembly for SR (Status Register) manipulation to disable/enable interrupts. This is fundamentally a CPU architecture concern, not an SAU-level concern - the same code would work on any m68k-based SAU.\n\nConsider reorganizing to something like:\n- `ec/arch/m68k/` for m68k-specific assembly\n- `ec/arch/x86/` for x86 equivalents (when porting)\n- Keep SAU-level splits only for actual hardware variant differences\n\nThis would make the retargetability goal clearer and avoid confusion about what each directory level represents.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-13T11:18:14.179673-08:00","created_by":"toshok","updated_at":"2026-01-13T11:18:14.179673-08:00"}
